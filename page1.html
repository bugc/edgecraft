                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                            The cutting edge has shape of V in cross section. When edge becomes worn we use steeling or honing to refresh the tip. But it wears out again and we repeat... V turns to U - got blunt. So it comes to apply new grind. BTW&nbsp;steeling by rod was considered bad habit and to be replaced with strapping or honing (with fine abrasives).<br>The grind depends on purpose and personal habits in general. Most of cooks does not care what bevel and grind it was. They think new grind 'sharp' when the knife is able to slice soft tomatoes. Same, the knife 'is good' if it takes much time (how?) to blunt edge to death.&nbsp;To be honest such situation is too common to judge people.&nbsp;<br>When customer asks to restore sharpeness like it was out of the box, the simpliest grind will be applied - 15° or 20° bevel per side. Two-step process with diamond abrasives and electric grinder are in use.&nbsp;</p>

                            Apply modern grind - עיצוב שפוע מודרני</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Old blades have tendency to bolder tips just because of wearing out or by design.&nbsp;Novadays we have technology to convert legacy blades and give appropriate care for modern western knives.
<br>Regular V-shape could be upgraded to two-bevel or even three-bevel when each side of edge arc is alike chisel - suitable for hard work wear out combined with finest slice and cut ability.<br>Thicker edge tip offers benefits of lower pressure needed to cut (thus lighter hand on repetative actions).&nbsp;With proper care most of old-style blades can withstand 15° bevel and\or thicker tip.<br>To have lightweight cutting experience two improvements could be suggested - make edge tip ticker and change bevels to 25°-30° (in total).</p>

                            What ever more?- תיקון ועבדות שנות</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Some knives need repair: refine a line of blade, some polishing or grip fix... To be polite not everything should be repaired but could.
<br>There is no 'best' grind because new habits arise with each change. Same knife, same matherial but you have being changed. The grind and honing practice both are involved in such a process. When you get familiar with new performance some tool for 'edge restoration' is needed. Actually I do not suggest strope or honing bar either. Double bevel grind is better accomplished with 'coarse' diamond sharpening when saw-alike pattern is applied to fine finished arc shoulders. That means need of periodical restoration of bevels too. So, there is no grind as 'wear proof' or 'self sharpening'.<br>Look into web links section for my selection of handy tools.
